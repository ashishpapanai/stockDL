## ** pyBhushan** [Draft]
**pyBhushan** is a begginer friendly shares yield predictor based on the trends of past 6 years. The model is an LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) based which is an improved version for a reccurent neural network. 

**pyBhushan** leaves it to the user to understand the share price using two widely used stock trading stratergies and two Deep Learning stratergies:
- Buy and Hold
- Moving Average
- LSTM [Long Short Term Memory]
- LSTM with 1D Convolutions
All stratergies are explained in the project documentation for the reference of developers. 

The readme will be updated as the project moves towards completion and any significant progress is made in the code.
